			<h4>No Hosting Worries</h4>
			<p>Our very first version of GotToVote, helping citizens find registration centres nearest to them was served using GitHub pages and the data from Google Fusion Tables. Both very reliable services that incurred no cost and while other similar services buckled under the load, ours coasted through without breaking a sweat.</p>
